# To-Do-List
Using React ,JS ES6, HTML &amp; CSS
I created a CRUD application.Here is a simplified version of the steps I took. First, I set state and created a list of to dos. Next, I created a form for the input so I could add items to the list. After, I created an on click event to remove items. Finally, we refactor the componets and I added some extra styling elements.
